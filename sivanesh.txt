Hello, buddy this is a test file.

Your mind creates disasters
That never arrive.

You suffer twice.
Once in imagination.
Once in reality.

Most battles never happen.
But the damage still feels real.

Fear lives in prediction.
Strength lives in presence.

Remember — reality is kinder than imagination.
